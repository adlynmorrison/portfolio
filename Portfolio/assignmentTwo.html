        <p>There have been many articles written in the case against fast food
        but recently Michael Moss, a Pulitzer Prize–winning investigative
        reporter for The Times, wrote an expose on Big Food companies. In
        detail, Moss explores how the food companies “hyper-engineered,
        savagely marketed, addiction-creating battle for 'stomach
        share.'”</p><button id="b2">Next</button>

      <article id="circle3">
        <p>The article starts with a secret meeting depicted in Minneapolis, MN
        Big Food companies in which they were told, under no uncertain terms
        about obesity rates in correlation to their processed foods that they
        needed to take responsibility for, and refused in any way to change
        their ways. The article looks at several foods optimized for consumers
        such as Dr. Pepper, Lunchables, and Cheetos, sugary, salty, fatty foods
        that are not good in the quantities American consume
        them.</p><button id="b3">Next</button>

      <article id="circle4">
        <p>Opponents of intense attacks on food companies that will is the
        ultimate decision behind choosing foods that cause diabetes, obesity,
        and hypertension. Moss says otherwise. Moss articles points out that
        people overestimate sheer will power. It flatters egos to believe that
        they cannot be manipulated, which is largely an illusion. The food
        companies spend millions of dollars to find the perfect version of a
        product in “labs and marketing meeting” to get people hooked on foods
        that are “convenient and inexpensive.” Companies research color to the
        perfect break point for a potato chip to consumers who, while not
        powerless, are vulnerable to “industrial formulations and selling
        campaigns.”</p><button id="b4">Next</button>

      <article id="circle5">
        <p>Opponents like A. Barton Hinkle, says the thought of companies
        trying to please their consumers a sneaky, underhanded thing to do, and
        therefore morally wrong hilarious. What researchers do is no different
        from what many people who spend copious amounts of time on their
        product that is what they are paid for. Companies should spend every
        waking moment making products better, it is one of the byproducts of
        free market capitalism.</p><button id="b5">Next</button>

      <article id="circle6">
        <p>Some criticizers of the food industry are looking towards the
        government to make food companies take responsibility for their
        formulations and their aggressive marketing campaigns. Opponents,
        however, maintain that it was the government's fault to begin with
        –starting with corn subsidies that have turned everything into a corn
        product. The government is also responsible for favoring single-family
        homes and zoning for big box stores resulting in the suburban sprawl
        for white Americans and car culture. For blacks left behind in
        America’s cities, governmental policies resulted in functioning and
        healthy communities to falter and create the very food deserts Michelle
        Obama and food activists are trying to reverse.</p><button id=

      <article id="circle7">
        <p>Redlining was common amongst banks and insurance companies so that
        individuals and businesses could not receive the financing needed to
        buy or maintain property. Freeways and eminent domain plowed through
        areas deemed not worth preserving, ruining businesses and
        neighborhoods. Policies ensured whole swaths of land where brown people
        like me lived would not see investment dollars, would not see growth,
        would not see health, and would not continue to flourish.~ The Boxcar
